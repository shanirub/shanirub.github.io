Hi, I'm Shani. I'm a software engineer. I also tend to overthink, and I have a keyboardâ€”hence, a blog.

But seriously, this blog has two goals:

   1. To keep track of projects I'm working on.
   2. To keep track of areas of interest in technology.

Sometimes these two goals intersect.

Previously, I tried achieving these goals by writing notes in numerous documents and posting on Mastodon. It got messy, so I thought a blog would be a better solution.

I don't intend for this blog to be a showcase of skills and achievements, but feel free to read and be amazed. :-)
