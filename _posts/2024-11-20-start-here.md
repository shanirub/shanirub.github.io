I thought I needed a place where I can update on my projects instead of random toots on Mastodon.

Current stuff I'm researching/working on:

1. My [ecommerce project](https://github.com/shanirub/ecommerce), in which I experiment with web development, databases, deployment, etc.
2. My Raspi project - a sniffer that turns packets into beeps, with some additional logic. A place to practice Rust programming, sniffing, beeps, and, of course, connecting electronic elements, which makes everything much cooler by definition.  
   - Python proof of concept: [PacketBeeps](https://github.com/shanirub/packetbeeps)  
   - Rust version: [PacketBeeps-Rust](https://github.com/shanirub/packetbeeps-rust)
3. [Database design](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Beginning+Database+Design-p-9780764574900) â€“ Reading chapters from *Beginning Database Design*.
4. [OLAP vs. OLTP](https://www.illustratedbytes.com/blog/series_olap/01-oltp-vs-olap/) and [this Oracle guide](https://www.oracle.com/il-en/database/what-is-oltp/).
5. [COBOL programming on Mainframe](https://ibmzxplore.influitive.com/forum/). Because let's face it, we have no idea what the afterlife looks like, but we can assume it runs on a bunch of Mainframes with legacy code implementing heaven and hell.
