START HERE

I thought a need a place where i can update on my projects, instead of random toots on mastodon.

Current stuff I'm researching / working on:

1. My ecommerce project, in which I experiment with web development, databases, deployment etc.
2. My raspi project - a sniffer that turns packets into beeps, with some additional logic. A place to practice Rust programming, sniffing, beeps and of course connecting electronic elements which makes everything much cooler by definition.
3. Database design.
4. OLAP vs. OLTP
5. Cobol programming on Mainframe. Because let's face it, we have no idea how the afterlife looks, but we can assume it runs on a bunch of Mainframes with a legacy code to implement heaven and hell.
